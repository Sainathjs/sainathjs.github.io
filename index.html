                Shardula-ai uses computing and Artificial Intelligence to
                connect children to their roots, Sanskrit and Sanskriti.
                We have developed an ecosystem to enable Programming in Sanskrit. <br><br>

                To get started, for the interested, a 5 hrs session spanning 3 to 10 days
                is introduced. This enables participants to write small
                programs in Sanskrit, resulting in simple drawings/paintings !!! <br> <br> 

                We have created an app to write program which requires knowledge of any one Indian 
                script like Devnagri, Kannada, Malayalam etc. One can learn 
                programming here without prior experience in Sanskrit or Programming. <br><br>
                
                Programs written by 3 children is shared in "WORK" section.               
            </div>

            <div id = "about">
		Shardula-ai was started in August 2020 with an aim to 
                to empower society using the Artificial Intelligence as a tool. <br> <br>

		Shardula in Sanskrit means Tiger. 
                The tiger cub, our logo, is curious and brave to explore. <br> <br>
                
                We have introduced Sanskrit based programming language. 
                As a measure of simplicity to learn this, a group of children were
                given 10 classes spanning 30-40 minutes each.
                And this lead them to paint cute pictures using programming !!! <br><br>

                We have an app with a devnagri keyboard and this enables computing 
                using Sanskrit using Devnagri, or a local script. <br><br>

                You can apply for the app/course through CONTACT link above.
